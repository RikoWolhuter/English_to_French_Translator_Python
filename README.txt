English to French Translation - Transformer model vs RNN model

Description
The analysis aims to train a translator, a sequence-to-sequence RNN model on multiple texts(English and French). The analysis uses the English-French Translation dataset, that consists of 22.5 million sentences in French and English. The model will also be evaluated and improved on. Apache Spark is utilized so that we can import data in a robust and efficient way.
